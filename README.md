# DevTrain LMS

An internal learning management system tailored for DevOps training.

## Project Overview

This project is a portfolio demonstration of building a full-stack web app with DevOps best practices:

- Backend: FastAPI + PostgreSQL
- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
- Infrastructure: Docker Compose for local dev, GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Observability: Prometheus, Grafana (planned)
- Security: Automated scanning and testing pipelines (planned)

## Goals

- Provide developers with self-paced DevOps training and quizzes.
- Track learning progress and assessment results.
- Showcase end-to-end DevOps skills: infrastructure as code, CI/CD, monitoring, and security.
